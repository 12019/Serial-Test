            please try the <a href="index.html#mlist">mailing list</a> too...</li>
            <li> Basically it's a maintenance release with lot of debugging.</li>
            <li> The OpenGLContext creation has been rewrite / enhanced to be more
            easily customizable</li>
            <li> The GL generator.exe generated incorrect code, it has been fixed.
            (and the OpenGL_Extension file regenerated)</li>
            <li> A rarely see issue with incorrect calling convention on DllImport attribute fixed</li>
            <li> OpenGLContext(s) could now share their display list with other context,
            customize your context to take advantage of this feature and save video memory !<br/>
            of course <b>CsGL.OpenGL.ContextLocal</B> class take advantage of this feature.</li>
            <li> GDITextureFont work now very fine and simply. And you have a basic example 
            <tt>&lt;csgl&gt;/examples/CS/gdifont.cs</tt></li>
            <li> mouse &amp; keyboard event management work now very fine and there is an associated

            <p><b>CsGLExamples 0.9.0 BETA</b> has been released!</p>
            <p>This release is a beta for CsGL users and the original authors of these ports
               to review and make any suggestions or offer any assistance before the "public"
               release.  Most of the Redbook and NeHe lessons are there, as well as, a few
               others.  (I think there's 99 in this package).  I could use help testing each 
               of these examples, looking for bugs, correcting known issues, and improving 
               performance.  Please offer any support you can.  Read the included README.txt 
               which should answer most of your questions and show you areas where your 
               contributions would be most valuable.</p>
            <p>You can get the CsGLExamples package from the Downloads link to your left, 
               it includes all the source, precompiled release binaries, and data required for 
               the examples (textures, sounds, etc).  It's a big file.  To run the examples, 
               you'll need the .Net Framework, I've compiled against 1.0 SP2 (note I've 
               compiled these against 1.1 beta as well and saw no improvement in speed, in fact 
               they were slightly slower and used slightly more RAM, so until 1.1 is final I'll 
               only distribute the 1.0 version).  CsGL has been included both in release and 
               debug forms, this CsGL is slightly more up-to-date than 1.4.0, however, Lloyd 
               is working on updating CsGL with the things included here and fixing/improving the 
               additions (essentially the only new things here are the GLUT shapes, which are 
               really slow due to the multidimensional arrays I used in my quick and dirty 
               implementation, and the *hedrons are being corrupted somewhere, so they look all 
               whack.  Also some new safe wrappers have been added to GL.cs.  I've included 
               GLUT.cs, though it's compiled into CsGL, in the src directory of the release, 
               if anyone is interested or wants to improve the speed/search for the corruption).  
               To compile these you'll need to get NAnt.  All of this information is covered in 
               the README.txt.  I've also opened a CsGL Examples forum, for feedback, or you can 
               email me.</p>
            <p>Also, if you can implement a missing example, or provide a new example, especially 
               one scheduled to be done in the future (as per the roadmap in the README file), that'd 
               be great.  I'd also gladly accept any custom examples you've done and want included.  
               It'd be nice if you could follow the coding conventions used here, including 
               the usage of the basecode.  If you have suggestions, additions, corrections, improvements 
               for the basecode, it'd be really nice to recieve these quickly.</p>
            <p>There's some documentation for the basecode in CsGLExamples\src\CsGL.Basecode\doc. I
               haven't looked over it closely, so there may be some issues with it.  Also I don't suggest
               compiling the documentation yourself (nant build-doc) as it takes forever.  It took
               me close to 6 hours to compile the docs...  NDOC is unbelieveably slow and I don't know why,
               but it produces great documentation.</p>
            <p>I hope to get a public 1.0.0 release done in the next couple weeks, depending on my 
               schedule.  At this time I'll post the examples on gotdotnet, go-mono, and nehe, and 
               hopefully by doing so we'll get some new CsGL users.  So please, if you see issues 
               or can offer support, please do so now, rather than waiting a couple weeks.</p>
            <p>I'd like to thank Lloyd Dupont, Amir Ghezelbash, Jeff Molofee, Robert Schaap, and 
               Steve Wortham for help on this release and/or providing their examples to be ported.</p>
            <p>Thanks, Randy Ridge</p>

            <ul>
            <li> Version <b>1.4.0</b> released!</li>
            <li> OpenGL 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 &amp; 50 additional extensions supported.</li>
            <li> If you have the latest extension header for  
            SomeNiftyNewExtensionFromCompanyX you could now automatically 
            generate the CsGL extension file with <tt>glgenerator.exe</tt> in the 
            <tt>&lt;CsGL&gt;extras\generator</tt> directory. It comes both
            precompiled and with source. Check the <tt>README</tt> file first if you want to hack it.
            <li> Mouse (including Cursor utility) and Keyboard class added to CsGL.Util</Li>
            <li> New related project,  
            <a href="http://www21.brinkster.com/trapalas/">http://www21.brinkster.com/trapalas/</a>
            is a skin file reader and cloth simulator...  very nice demo!</li>
            <li> The NeHe tutorials have been taken out of the base distribution and will be found 
            in a separate package, where a new developer (thanks Randy) is doing a really
            wonderful job and a LOT of tutorials.</a></li>
            <li> One last thing, I dropped Managed C++, this release is cleaner and is 
            only comprised of C&#35; and C. This will make it easier to port to other platforms...
            (provided you have System.Windows.Forms... of course)</li>
            <li> The regular CsGL forum is broken and until it's fixed we're back to using the forum on
            SourceForge.</li>
            <li><b>BUG</b> There is a small pointer corruption somewhere, which I was not able
			to track until now and I know a very few case where glGetString() and
			OpenFileDialog (?!) doesn't work as intended.</li>

            <li> version 1.3.1 released. BUGFIXES </li>
            <li> some people have no drawing. Due to an incorrect report of DOUBLEBUFFER
            flags for some videocard. This could lead to other problems (incorrect choosing
             of display type), but at least the drawing occur now. </li>
            <li> a few change in NeHe example, you could "run.bat" or "make" 
            without ResBuilder (that is, without embing the resources). </li>
            <li> there is a VS.NET project wich could build csgl. It only build the weak
            named version, that you couldn't install.
            (first uninstall csgl if you want to use it).</li>

            <ul>
            <li> version 1.1 released <p></li>
            <li> what you all wait for without daring to ask: a Document-view update
            of CSGL. Commit me to make a lot of change. This new architecture lie mainly on
            2 new object <b>GLView</b>, an OpenGLControl, displaying the new <b>OpenGLModel</b>
            object. </br>
            It also have built in navigation feature.
            <li>A document (that is <b>OpenGLModel</b>) could be see on a lot of different
            view at the same time this lead me to create <b>ContextLocal</b> object, an
            object wich transparently manage OpenGLContext local instance of any object,
            and one of its most valuable subclass: <b>DisplayList</b>. </li>
            <li> a new example (<i>./examples/OO</i>) which is quite unfinished now,
            but provide a nice skeleton of model viewing application. </br>
            help you to go very rapidly in OpenGL code test without bothering with
            all init/GUI/etc.. stuff
            <p></li>
            <li> now in binary distribution there is <b>lib</b> and <b>libinstall</b> directory 
            (respectively build with <i>make</i> and <i>make install</i> commands). The first one
            is an anonymous assembly (which cannot be installed and should lie in
            you application directory), the other one has a strong name and could be installed
            with the <i>install.bat</i> provided
            <p></li>
            <li> Paul Michael Saunders (<a href=mailto:nus@bigfoot.com>nus@bigfoot.com</a>)
            take the SDL project project under his responsability, and could now be found
            at  <a href= http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net>http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net</a>
            <p></li>

                <li>SystemError.Assert(), which test win32 error

            this for maintenance reason. </i>
